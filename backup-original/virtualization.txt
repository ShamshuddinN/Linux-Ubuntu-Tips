Setting Up QEMU/KVM on Ubuntu 24.04: It is easy!

>> egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
If output >= 1 You are good to go.

Run below commands:
>> sudo apt update
>> sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager

>> sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER
>> sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER

- Logout and Login (You can also do a restart)

>> newgrp libvirt
>> newgrp kvm

Now you will see an application named "Virtual Machine Manager" in apps menu launch it.
Could not see it? Try restarting it.
Or try running it with below command:
>> virt-manager

Now You'll see a GUI where you can:
- Create a new VM
- Choose an ISO file (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)
- Allocate RAM, CPU, disk size
- Boot and run your VM

Thats it!
